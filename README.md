#Mura ORM

* These exercise files are intended to be used in conjunction with the Mura ORM training presentation
* Place this entire directory under the `/{MuraWebRoot}/`. This way, you can just navigate directly to each lab exercise (or even the `sql` directory) in your browser by visiting `http://localhost:8888/mura-orm/` (assuming you're using this with **Mura Express**).
* As you try each of the `mura-orm` exercises, copy the `/beans` directory from each exercise under either your Site or Theme's `/model` directory. *You'll be replacing the `beans` directory on each exercise!* 
* Then, you'll need to reload Mura and applydbupdates: `http://localhost:8888/?appreload&applydbupdates`. This will register the bean(s) and create any necessary tables.
* The `index.cfm` file located under each exercise can be navigated to directly to see the output generated.
